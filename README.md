# Job Change into Data Scientists Prediction
* Create machine learning models that help the HR department to predict job change into data scientists.
* Interpretation of relationship between independent variables and dependent variables (job change).
* Create and compare various machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and KNeighbors classifier) that predict job change.
* Optimize the machine learning models with GridSearchCV.
* Evaluate the machine learning models using regression evaluation metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1_score).
